        Use the box-decoration-slice and box-decoration-clone utilities to
        control whether properties like background, border, border-image, <br />
        box-shadow, clip-page, margin, and padding should be rendered as if the
        element were one continuous fragment, or distinct blocks..

      totalWidth = w
    </div>
    <div>
      When controlling the flow of text, using the CSS property
      <span class="inline bg-purple-200">display: inline</span>
      will cause the text inside the element to wrap normally. While using the
      property
      <span class="inline-block bg-purple-200">display: inline-block</span> will
      wrap the element to prevent the text inside from extending beyond its
      parent. Lastly, using the property
      <span class="block bg-purple-200">display: block</span>
      will put the element on its own line and fill its parent.

        Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe.
        Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid,
        sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local
        library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the
        Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better? Look. If
        you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better
        think again. This is about that kid's right to read a book without
        getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe
        that's how y'get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies.
